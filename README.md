# bocchithebridge
a simple Minecraft Bridge bot for Discord using Discord.js and Mineflayer

## Infomation about the repo.
- This is (probably) a continuation of bocchithebot, lets you chat with people on Discord while you're playing Minecraft.
- (Why is this seperated from bocchithebot?) : Because bocchithebot is a console-only Mineflayer bot, people asked me to
make a Discord bridge version of the bot with a slightly recode on it.

## Setup
- The repo is not finished or on a stable version. Sorry.

### How can i contribute?
- I don't know lol :)
