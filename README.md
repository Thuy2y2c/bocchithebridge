# A Mineflayer bot made mainly for shitposting

bocchithebridge is a Discord Bridge between Minecraft and Discord chats.

[[***bocchithebridge discord server***]](https://discord.gg/24bEdQBzHg)

## Infomation about the repo.
- This is a updated version of bocchithebot, lets you chat with people on Discord while you're playing Minecraft.
- (Why is this seperated from bocchithebot?) : Because bocchithebot is a console-only Mineflayer bot, people asked me to
make a Discord bridge version of the bot with a slightly recode on it.
- (Why is it named "bocchithebot" or "bocchithebridge"?) : It's named for my favorite show while listening to Joji

## Setup
- Download the current .zip release in the Release tab.
- Once downloaded, extract the .zip and there will be a folder
- Check that your computer has already installed Node.js yet
- Once checked that Node.js is installed, open the folder using Visual Studio Code (recommended)
- Rename env.example into .env and enter your Discord (bot) Token into it.
- Go to the config.json, configure it by adding your bot name, channel id, prefix and Discord prefix
- Then go to index.js and replace the current default server config with the server you desired. (There's no auto-auth lol)
- Once everything is all configured, go to the terminal and run npm i to install the required packages
- Once you installed all the packages. Check if theres something wrong with your configuration and then run
`node .` and the bot should work!
